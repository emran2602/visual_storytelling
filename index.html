    <h2>Swensons</h2>
    <p>Swensen’s has been a big player in the ice cream game since 1948, when it first opened in Russian Hill. San Francisco has gone through many changes since then, but some well-known flavors, like sticky chewy chocolate, have never left the Swensen’s menu. 
      </p>
    <p>
      Although Sticky Chewy Chocolate is decadent and delicious, Israel Lopez, the manager and Cali Jade, a long standing employee, state that Swensen’s “gets a lot of regulars that come in” and “a lot of the regulars are super friendly so a lot of people come many times a week.” 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Jade and Lopez recall regular customers such as “this one lady gets our caramel turtle fudge on a sugar cone every time” and “one guy who likes to get a pint of ice cream but he gets it in a quart container with vanilla and hot fudge on it and he just eats it with the spoon.” They continue to create their legacy as “people travel to Swensen’s because they’ve had it somewhere else through their childhood and they missed it,” which also explains the number of children and old and young customers. Its willingness to give back to the community they have created also contributes to its legacy. A friend of Swensen’s organizes community cleanups that Swensen’s sponsors to give free ice cream to further better the community in Russian Hill. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Swensen’s is aware that it competes with shops that have less traditional flavors. Many people including food influencer, Nick Chung, agree that having an “enticing factor of a flavor that people are like ‘What is that? Why would I even eat that?’ are what attracts people.” To keep up, Swensen’s created seasonal flavors: black licorice and pumpkin in October and eggnog in December.

    <h2>Mitchell's</h2>
    <p>It’s tucked in a corner and seemingly easy-to-miss, but chances are, you’ve seen a line wrapped around the street for this treasured landmark. Mitchell’s Ice Cream prides itself on its consistency — according to Jorge Villa, a supervisor at Mitchell’s, the shop has been following the same recipes since opening day. 
      Villa credits the shop’s ongoing success to “the consistency that traditional flavors have.” 
      “There are people that will come through and say, ‘Well, I've been coming here since I was like a little kid and it was like 20 years ago, 30 years ago,’” Villa said. “I believe they wouldn’t be coming back if it wasn't the same flavor or same experiences they've always had.” 
      Though Mitchell’s has expanded its flavor selection since it opened in 1953, its most well-known flavors, which are Filipino and Southeast Asian-inspired, have been around since the 70s and continue to bring back regular customers and families across generations. Villa notes his effort to pass on the tradition of friendly service, particularly to regular customers he has gotten to know over his 9 years working at Mitchell’s. “I feel like people come back, you know. It's the service, everything. It's just the experience here. I feel like it's always one of the best ones you can have at an ice cream shop,” Villa said. When speaking about places that become regular spots, food influencer Nick Chung also stated that “what I value in food places is definitely when the staff or the owner really make an effort to be friendly, nice, and polite,” which Mitchell’s emphasizes.
      Though the founders have now retired, their devotion for Mitchell’s hasn’t. Mitchell’s continues to further solidify its designation as an established landmark in San Francisco and was recently named a legacy business establishment, a certification granted to culturally-impactful, historic businesses. Villa imagines their tried-and-true traditions will triumph for many years to come. 
      “That [recognition] was very important to the owners because we've been established as part of this city since 1953  [...] It'll still be packed out the door on certain days,” Villa said. “It's good for them to know that people still enjoy this place.”

    <h2>Lush Gelato</h2>
    <p>Lush Gelato is located in the heart of Little Italy. This place prides itself in the gelato it sells, making sure it serves the community with fresh, home-made gelato. It is the first facility to be licensed by the State of California to make gelato from scratch. This means the shopthey pasteurizespasterize itstheir own milk and, make itstheir own mixes, giving them more control over what flavours they choose. Freshness is a big pillar of theirs. Rosario Khalil, (the store manager,) said thatmentions how making their own gelato from scratch ensures that it is not elastic, sticky or icy. Now that is how you know the gelato is fresh. It is made every single day otherwise their prized gelato would not be up to standard. This culture preserves the Italian heritage that cements Lush Gelato within Little Italy.
