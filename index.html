          In San Francisco, new, hip ice cream shops like Salt & Straw sell cricket-flavored ice cream. Places such as Bi-Rite Creamery have their eyes set on basil and honey lavender flavors.  But a few old-school parlors have been around for decades. What keeps people coming back?

            Swensen’s has been a big player in the ice cream game since 1948, when it first opened in Russian Hill. San Francisco has gone through many changes since then, but some well-known flavors, like sticky chewy chocolate, have never left the Swensen’s menu. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Swensen’s gets a lot of regulars, according to Israel Lopez, the store manager, and Cali Jade, a longtime employee. “A lot of the regulars are super friendly so a lot of people come many times a week,” Jade said.     </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            Both Jade and Lopez can recall specific regular customers. “This one lady gets our caramel turtle fudge on a sugar cone every time,” Lopez said. Jade remembered a customer who regularly bought a full pint of ice cream. “He gets it in a quart container with vanilla and hot fudge on it and he just eats it with the spoon.”    </p>

            “People travel to Swensen’s because they’ve had it somewhere else through their childhood and they missed it,” Jade said.     </p>

            Lopez said that the shop also maintains its legacy by giving back to the community. A friend of Swensen’s organizes regular community cleanups that Swensen’s sponsors to give free ice cream to keep the neighborhood clean and strengthen the community in Russian Hill. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, Swensen’s is aware that it competes with shops that have less traditional flavors. And flavors attract people, said Nick Chung, a local social media food influencer. “People are like ‘What is that? Why would I even eat that?’” Merging old with new, Swensen’s has created seasonal flavors like black licorice and pumpkin in October and eggnog in December.

            Mitchell’s Ice Cream is relatively small and might be easy to miss, if not for the line — often wrapped around the street. The treasured San Francisco landmark prides itself on consistency — the shop has been following the same recipes since opening day, according to Jorge Villa, a supervisor at Mitchell’s.

        <div class="mitchells-p">
          <p>
            “There are people that will come through and say, ‘Well, I've been coming here since I was like a little kid and it was like 20 years ago, 30 years ago,’” Villa said. “I believe they wouldn’t be coming back if it wasn't the same flavor or same experiences they've always had.” 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mitchells-p">
          <p>
            Though Mitchell’s has expanded its flavor selection since it opened in 1953, its most well-known flavors, which are Filipino and Southeast Asian-inspired, have been around since the 1970s and continue to bring back regular customers, including multiple generations of families. Villa notes his effort to pass on the tradition of friendly service, particularly to the regular customers whom he has gotten to know over his nine years working at Mitchell’s.

              “I feel like people come back, you know. It's the service, everything. It's just the experience here,” Villa said. “I feel like it's always one of the best ones you can have at an ice cream shop.”

            “What I value in food places is definitely when the staff or the owner really make an effort to be friendly, nice, and polite,” said Chung, the food influencer. The founders, Larry and Jack Mitchell, have retired, but the shop was recently named a legacy business establishment – a certification granted to culturally impactful, historic businesses. Villa imagines their tried-and-true traditions will triumph for many years to come.

            “That [recognition] was very important to the owners because we've been established as part of this city since 1953  [...] It'll still be packed out the door on certain days,” Villa said. “It's good for them to know that people still enjoy this place.”

              Lush Gelato, in the heart of Little Italy, prides itself in serving the community with homemade gelato — just the way nonna likes it. The shop was the first facility in San Francisco to be licensed to make gelato from scratch, according to Rosario Khalil, the manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We pasteurize our own milk,” Khalil said. “Most of the other ice cream shops don’t have that. We don’t buy our mixes from nobody else.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Keeping the heritage of an Italian creamery alive in San Francisco means making it daily for the authentic feel and taste.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Gelato has to be made fresh,” Khalil said. “ Every single day. The creaminess and freshness is going to be very different if you get it from somewhere else. It would look drippy or elastic. If you go to another [shop] you will see a shiny layer on top. That means it’s old.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              When a customer enters the shop, they’re greeted with just 12 flavors, including stracciatella, homemade cookies & cream and fresh mint chips. “[That’s] what you gotta do for quality versus quantity,” Khalil said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Business comes mostly from locals, Khalil added. “We try to donate to schools when they come in. We’re always trying to give back to the community in that sense,” said Khalil.
